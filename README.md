# Network Analysis toolbox



This toolbox is designed for my own job about calculating important parameter of DTI network (using AAL template)

It has not been fully tested before uploading and it has been proved work well in non-directional weighted network.

The parameters include:

## 



### Clustering coefficient

### Density

### Strength

### Degree

### Characteriastic path length

### Efficiency





As a phd student, I am tired of using toolbox download in the Internet,  and I think I got nothing during the research. So I decide to rewrite each toolbox that I have used. I do know that this toolbox is simple, but it is a good start for me.

In the next week, I will use my spare time to use fsl and Matlab to substitute PANDA in my work.
